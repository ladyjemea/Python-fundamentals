    "Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of objects and classes. Objects are instances of classes, which can encapsulate both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and abstraction in software design. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.\n",

    "Abstraction in Python, achieved through abstract base classes, allows you to define common interfaces and hide implementation details. This promotes a cleaner, more modular design by enabling you to focus on the high-level behavior of objects rather than their internal workings. By using abstract methods, you can enforce that subclasses provide specific behavior, ensuring consistency across different implementations."
